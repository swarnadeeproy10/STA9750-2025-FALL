# Welcome

Hello and welcome to my project submission site for **STA 9750: Data Science and Business Analytics** at Baruch College, CUNY.  

This site is designed to organize and showcase my coursework, mini-projects, and submissions throughout the semester. Each section highlights a different aspect of the course — from exploratory data analysis and modeling to decision-making and optimization.

## About Me

I am a Master’s student in **Business Analytics at Baruch College (CUNY)** with a strong focus on **data science, analytics, and decision modeling**. My academic journey and professional interests revolve around applying quantitative methods, machine learning, and optimization techniques to solve real-world business problems.  

I enjoy working with tools like **R, Python, SQL, and Quarto**, and I am especially interested in applying data-driven approaches in **finance, consulting, and business strategy**.
