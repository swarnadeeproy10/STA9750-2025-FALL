    "text": "Hello and welcome to my project submission site for STA 9750: Data Science and Business Analytics at Baruch College, CUNY.\nThis site is designed to organize and showcase my coursework, mini-projects, and submissions throughout the semester. Each section highlights a different aspect of the course — from exploratory data analysis and modeling to decision-making and optimization.\n\n\n\nI am a Master’s student in Business Analytics at Baruch College (CUNY) with a strong focus on data science, analytics, and decision modeling. My academic journey and professional interests revolve around applying quantitative methods, machine learning, and optimization techniques to solve real-world business problems.\nI enjoy working with tools like R, Python, SQL, and Quarto, and I am especially interested in applying data-driven approaches in finance, consulting, and business strategy.\n\n\n\n\n\nMini-Projects & Assignments – Hands-on applications of concepts learned in class.\n\nCase Studies & Reports – Analytical write-ups with insights and recommendations.\n\nCode & Documentation – Reproducible workflows using R and Quarto.\n\nThis site will evolve as the semester progresses. I will continue to update it with my work and reflections as I deepen my expertise in business analytics.\n\n\n\n\n\nName: Swarnadeep Roy\n\nProgram: Master’s in Business Analytics, Baruch College (CUNY)\n\nGitHub: github.com/swarnadeeproy10\n\n\nThank you for visiting my site — stay tuned for updates!\n\nLast Updated: Sunday 09 07, 2025 at 21:45PM"
